# Contributing to the Configu documentation

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Configu!

Don't feel shy about contributing! All input is welcome. No fix is too trivial.

If something confuses you or feels lacking about the docs, please feel free to make an issue. If you find something that you think you can fix, please go ahead. You don't need to ask permission.

If you haven't previously contributed to other open source project, make sure to familiarize yourself with the [Contributor Covenant](https://contributor-covenant.org/).

## Prerequisites

### MDX

The documentation content is [MDX-based](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/#markdown), specifically the second version. Make sure you know how to write proper MDX before you dive in!

A list of common gotchas:

- MDX supports standard markdown (a.k.a `CommonMark`). GFM, which stands for GitHub-Flavoured Markdown, **is not supported**
- Know what is [interleaving](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/#interleaving)
- Pass HTML attributes as JSX (e.g. use `className` instead of `class`)

### Path-prefixing

Documentation is connected to the main Configu's website using [rewrite proxy](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/cloud/working-with-redirects-and-rewrites/#rewrites-and-reverse-proxies), and the documentation part is build using Gatsby's `--path-prefix` flag.

What's important to understand:

- in dev mode, when working locally, there won't be any `/docs` part visible in documentation urls. Your entry point will be `localhost:8000`
- in production, or when you run `npm run build` command, the `/docs` prefix will be added to all paths on the site, making entry point `localhost:9000/docs`

Learn more on [path prefixing here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/previews-deploys-hosting/path-prefix/)

## Writing

For small changes and spelling fixes, the GitHub UI is most convenient.
For larger contributions, consider running the project locally to see how the changes look like before making a pull request.
You can build locally with Node, as described in the project's [README](README.md).

Markdown files for the documentation are located in [`src/content`](./content) folder. The URL structure is generated by page frontmatter `slug` field.

Sidebar data is stored in the [`src/content/sidebar.json`](./content/sidebar.json) file.

Each Markdown page should start with the following frontmatter.

```yaml
---
slug: <page-slug>
title: <page title>
---
```

1. `slug` — the string with path to the page (required)
2. `title` — title of the page (required)

## Sidebar

The source of truth for sidebar generation is stored in the [`src/content/sidebar.json`](./content/sidebar.json) file. The content in this file determines sidebar hierarchy.

To add a top-level sidebar section, place a sibling in a desired position inside top-level `items` array:

```json
{
  "items": [
    // your new item
    {
      "title": "Before the overview section",
      "items": [
        // add entries to pupulate the section with subpages
      ]
    },
    // an item that will lead user elsewhere from Configu's docs,
    // an external link. Must begin with `http`
    {
      "title": "An external link to app",
      "slug": "https://app.configu.com"
    },
    {
      "title": "Overview",
      "items": [
        { "title": "Introduction", "slug": "/" },
        { "title": "Architecture", "slug": "architecture" },
        { "title": "Quick Start Guide", "slug": "quick-start" },
        { "title": "Configu's Data privacy", "slug": "data-privacy" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

:warning: Note, that it is not enough to define a page in a sidebar for it to appear! For each page there has to be a corresponding `.md` file used for page generation.

**Attributes breakdown**:

- the `title` attribute is required and is a represenation of a certain `.md` page in sidebar. `title` may differ from the on inside the page
- `slug` should always match page's slug. Under the hood we define the active item by comparing current page url and the passed `slug` metadata. Also the sidebar links are being constructed using this attribute.

## Headings

It is prohibited to add `h1` to a page since it will be rendered automatically using the value from `title` field of frontmatter.

Use typical `##` markdown definition to format headings which stands for a `h2` tag, e.g:

```md
## Quick start
```

The table of content will being dynamically created on each page based on `h2` tags.

You can use `##` headers as landmarks, which stands for a `h2` tag. `h3` won't make to autogenerated table of content.

:warning: Note, that you can leverage only `h2`, `h3`, `h4` heading tags in your mdx content, as `h1` is reserved for the page title and `h5` and `h6` doesn't make sense to bring, because of the semantics and vertical rhythm.

## Images

The images should be sourced in docs directory and be used in `.md` with the relative path

```md
![Alt of an image](./configu-logo.png)
```

If you really have to put there some remote picture, write it like that:

```md
![Alt of an image](https://files.readme.io/9e92efd-insights-url-table-full.png)
```

But keep in mind the size of an image on the other side of a link to prevent page overweighting.

## Videos

You can embed videos with the native [video](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) tag.

In this case you have full control over the player – you can set the width and height, play videos automatically or not, mute or not, and so on.

A video element can contain one or more video sources. To specify the source of the video, the src attribute or the `<source>` element should be used - the browser will determine the most appropriate source:

```jsx
<video>
  <source type="video/webm" src="video.webm" />
  <source type="video/mp4" src="video.mp4" />
</video>
```

> Don't forget that videos can and should be optimised. Finding the right format and how to optimise your video will help you in this [article](https://pixelpoint.io/blog/web-optimized-video-ffmpeg/)

## Links

- Media links are the relative paths to the file (image or video), e.g. `./images/image.png`
- External links should begin with `https` protocol and will be shown with the small 🔗 icon to the right side. Only md-like links (`[]()`) are getting processed like this. If you want to get an icon at the `a`-tag external links, you need to specify the className as `external-link`.
- The relative links to other documentation pages should start with the slash `/`.

:warning: Note, that you should not specify `/docs` prefix manually in your relative links inside mdx content! It works automatically according to [path-prefix feature](#path-prefixing)

## Admonition

To improve the documentation readability, one can leverage an Admonition custom component. Wrap your piece of text with `<Admonition></Admonition>`, make sure content within starts end end with an empty line, and pass the type.

There are 5 types of Admonition: `note`, `warning`, `info`, `caution`, `tip`, ; the default is `note`.

You may also specify an optional title with prop `title`.

Example:

```md
<Admonition type="note" title="Your title">
// note the empty line
  The branch creation process does not increase load on the originating project. You can create a branch at any time without worrying about downtime or performance degradation.
// note the empty line
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info">
// note the empty line
  The branch creation process does not increase load on the originating project. You can create a branch at any time without worrying about downtime or performance degradation.
// note the empty line
</Admonition>
```

## Code Tabs

To display code tabs, wrap all pieces of code with `<CodeTabs></CodeTabs>` and write labels of code tabs in order:

````md
<CodeTabs labels={["Linux", "MacOs",]}>
// note the empty line

```shell
curl https://cli.configu.com/install.sh | sh
```

```shell
curl https://cli.configu.com/install.sh | sh
```

// note the empty line
</CodeTabs>
````

## The rest

The rest of elements you could write as you would in native md: links, images, inline code, tables etc.

## Custom

It is also possible that you want to use a custom UI block in a certain `.md` document, not defined in this guide, like CTA button, or really any other piece of content from normal react page.

By no means do not copypaste generated html into md file, just import the component you need right into `md` exactly the way you would import it on any react page and provide necessary props.

If you feel like you could use another custom component, feel free to raise an issue on this matter.

### Creating custom components

If the time is of the essence, you can create your own custom mdx component in no time.

1. Check out the [Gatsby documentation on this matter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx/#mdxprovider)
2. Create your component in `components/shared/your-component`
3. Import it in the [content.mdx](/src/components/pages/doc/content/content.jsx)
4. Extend the `components` constant accordingly
5. Use it like you would use `Admonition` or `CodeTabs`!

## Known limitations

### Make sure custom components' content is wrapped with empty lines

There is a parser underneath each of those, and it works on `children` prop, which is absent when empty lines are omitted

```md
// ok! proper functioning is guaranteed
<CustomComponent>
// note the empty line
Content with [link](/link)
// note the empty line
</CustomComponent>

// sometimes ok, but not always!
<CustomComponent>
Content with [link](/link)
</CustomComponent>

// not ok!
<CustomComponent>Content with [link](/link)</CustomComponent>
```

### Heading is just a heading

A heading is a piece of text that can be turned into a link, but nothing more. We programmatically generate anchors attributes and links in ToC, so the parser can be broken quite easily.

```md
// ok

## Heading

// also ok

## [Heading](/link)

// not ok, also that breaks the semantics

## [Heading](/link) [compound](/link2)
```

### Avoid using reserved symbols

```md
// parser will break trying to treat <..> as a jsx component
Piece of text that <uses.reserved> symbols

// []() is the notation for links in md, will break the parser as well
Piece of [text][that] uses reserved symbols

// {{...}} is the notation in mdx2 that assumes there is a js conde inside
Piece of {{text}} that uses reserved symbols
```

How to solve? Screen the symbols out with a `/` !

```md
Piece of text that \<uses.reserved\> symbols

Piece of \[text\]\[that\] uses reserved symbols

Piece of \{\{text\}\} that uses reserved symbols
```

### validateDOMNesting error in console on pages with tables

There is a bug with falsy white space warning when using tables in mdx content:

```shell
Warning: validateDOMNesting(...): Whitespace text nodes cannot appear as a child of <tr>. Make sure you don't have any extra whitespace between tags on each line of your source code..
```

The issue is open in MDX repo and can be tracked [here](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/issues/2000).

Current workaround is to wrap `thead` with curly brackets.

Example:

```mdx
{/* rest of content */}

  <table>
    {
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Concept</th>
        <th>Explanation</th>
        <th>Resources</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    }
    <tbody>
{/* rest of content */}
```

### Invalid left-hand side in prefix operation

This erorr usually pops up when your syntax is incorrect and the parser doesn't get a proper content to digest, thus failing to recognize the piece of content starting from the `frontmatter` record itself.

There is no know workaround on how to make this error more informative. Please, try to:

1. Check your mdx content is aligned with MDX spec
2. Check the usage of custom components
3. Check if you have screened out all the special characters that can be mistreated
