## Feature Settings

- **Domain Verification** - For increased security, we recommend that owners verify a domain via the Settings page so email accounts belonging to that domain can be added automatically to that organization.

## Organization Plan

<Admonition>
  Configu Orchestrator is open-source and free forever. For the Configu Cloud, we offer a generous
  free plan and we expect that many developers and teams will fall within this plan's limits. In
  this section, you can track how much you use and upgrade if needed.

- **Transfer Ownership** - Gives another member the owner role which has permissions for all organization resources. The previous owner is assigned the [default role](../authorization#default-role).
- **Delete this organization** - Permanently deletes the organization and its resources.
