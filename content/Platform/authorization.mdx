Configu provides role based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC). Managers (owners and admins) of an organization can assign roles and specific permissions to organization members and tokens according to their requirements.

RBAC and ABAC are inclusive, meaning that the member/token gets access to resources according to the union of all their respective roles and attributes.

## Default role

The default role applies to all new members. You may change the default role to any one of the predefined or custom roles to match your requirements.

<Admonition type="info">

- Changing the default role does not change the roles of existing members.
- Tokens receive a default role of reader and are not affected by the default role.

</Admonition>

## Predefined roles

Each predefined role is designed as a subset of the following one, providing a logical and hierarchical access control system.
Empower your organization with clear boundaries and well-defined roles that enhance collaboration, maintain security, and optimize productivity.

- Predefined roles are immutable and cannot be changed or deleted.
- The **Admin** role allows management of members, tokens, roles, webhooks, and organization settings.

## Assign roles

To assign roles to your [organization members](../members#assign-roles-to-a-member) or [organization tokens](../tokens#assign-roles-to-a-token), go to their respective pages and edit their roles.

## Creating a custom role

Take control of your organization's access management with our flexible and dynamic custom roles feature.
Every organization is unique, with specific requirements and workflows. That's why we empower you to create custom roles, allowing you to fine-tune access permissions according to your exact needs.

1. Go to the **Roles** page under the **Settings** tab
2. Click the **Create Role** button and provide the role name and role permissions.
3. After adding the role, you will see it listed in the custom roles list.
4. You can click **View details** to see a quick overview of the role definition.
